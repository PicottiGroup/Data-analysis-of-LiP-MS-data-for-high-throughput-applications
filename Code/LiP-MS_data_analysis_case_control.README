Here we describe the analysis pipeline for a case-control study, where protein structural alterations and abundance changes are compared between two conditions (S. cerevisiae cells treated with a short osmotic stress vs control). 
Data processing, quality control and statistical analysis is performed using the R-base package MSstatsLiP. 

Data to run the notebook is available on Zenodo:
