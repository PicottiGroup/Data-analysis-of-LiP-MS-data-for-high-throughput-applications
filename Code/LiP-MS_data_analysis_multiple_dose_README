Titration analysis with MSstatsLiP

MSstatsLiP offers the possibility to analyze data sets with multiple data points by adapting the linear
mixed effect model to account for between-subject heterogeneity over different data points. Here we
apply MSstatsLiP to a drug dose titration experiment where Rapamycin was added to a yeast lysate
at nine different concentrations (Piazza et al., 2020). 

Data to run the notebook is available on Zenodo:
